    description: "The Journey of the Smiski was a visual experiment in building emotion through space and posture. I approached each shot with a specific emotion or relationship in mind, and explored how scale, framing, and low light could communicate without text. The narrative is open-ended by design, allowing the viewer to project their own story onto the character’s journey.",

    description: "This was my first planned photo series using a mirrorless camera. I chose Sour Patch Kids as a subject not just because they were available, but because I saw potential in building small narratives around them. Before each photo, I tried to imagine what emotion or story I wanted to show. I used this project to explore camera settings, framing, and the early stages of storytelling through still images.",
