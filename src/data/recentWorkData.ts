    description: "The Journey of the Smiski was a visual experiment in building emotion through space and posture. I approached each shot with a specific emotion or relationship in mind, and explored how scale, framing, and low light could communicate without text. The narrative is open-ended by design, allowing the viewer to project their own story onto the character’s journey.",

    description: "This was my first planned photo series using a mirrorless camera. I chose Sour Patch Kids as a subject not just because they were available, but because I saw potential in building small narratives around them. Before each photo, I tried to imagine what emotion or story I wanted to show. I used this project to explore camera settings, framing, and the early stages of storytelling through still images.",

    description: "This series was built around the goal of understanding how light behaves at night. Before taking each photo, I thought carefully about the way shadows, artificial lighting, and color would influence the mood of the image. I wanted to test whether I could use contrast, emptiness, and framing to guide emotion and narrative in low-light scenes.",

    title: "Nature's Call",
    description: "In this series, I aimed to move beyond surface-level beauty and explore how natural environments can be used to test visual concepts like framing, symmetry, leading lines, and contrast. Each photo was composed with a purpose. I paid close attention to how color and light interacted with structure, using these tools to guide emotion and narrative. Rather than simply capturing nature, I worked to interpret it visually.",

    description: "This series was created to explore how urban spaces can be transformed into compelling compositions through framing, perspective, and visual rhythm. Before each shot, I considered how elements like lines, structures, textures, and negative space would interact. These images reflect a more advanced approach to photography where architectural elements and everyday objects are arranged to guide the viewer’s eye, emphasize symmetry, or create subtle tension.",
